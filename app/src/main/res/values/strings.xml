    <!-- Text Detail -->
    <string name="text_det">A few times in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals,
        the Warriors would make spurts of six or eight points, but never achieve sufficient
        escape velocity to get out of OKC’s orbit. This is rare, and they let the Thunder wander
        back into the game, which they eventually won. Not so much tonight. The Warriors took Game 2
        118-91, but really, Steph Curry slammed the door shut in less than two minutes in the third quarter.

        With 7:09 left in the quarter, Golden State led the Thunder by seven when Curry arched in a three-pointer.
        At 5:11, Curry wrong-footed Kevin Durant and Steven Adams on a pick-and-roll, then tossed in another three
        to swell the Warriors’ lead to 20. In the intervening minutes, Curry hit four free throws, sent in a long two
        on a transition play, and dribbled around Serge Ibaka to get another three. 15 points in 1:58 isn’t his most
        impressive scoring burst of these playoffs, but man, his third quarter informally ended the game 12 minutes early.
        Here’s his whole quarter, minus the free throws.</string>
